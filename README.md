# Multistage supply-chain network design
The logistics problem in the process of satifying consumer demand with the limited
supply has many elements to it, e.g. facility location, optimal distribution etc. Facility location
and supply network optimization do not, in many cases, capture the true essence of real life
logistics problem. Many companies deal with multi-stage logistics problem where optimizing the
production quantity, distribution network and supply network is required. Here, in this project
we are considering a multi-stage logistics problem which involves optimization of production
quatity, distribution network and supply network. To make this problem closer to the real life
situation we also have capacity constraints on supply quatity, production quantity and number of
facilities (production plants and distribution centers) to be chosen from the given set of possible
facility locations. Hence, this problem can viewed as a combination of multiple choice Knapsack
and Capacited location-allocation problem.
